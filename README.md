# ARKey
Keyboard and mouse controller for ARK

This program is created to suit my own needs when playing ARK, you are welcomed to download, modify and use it at your own risk! To use, simply download controller.exe and run. Please note that this program may only work on Windows.

How to use:
For Windows players just want to use my program, please go to 'releases' and download 'controller.exe' from the latest release. Run it just like any exe files and you should see a window opened. All hotkey functions will be available as long as the window is alive. Close the window will terminite the program and stop all hotkey functions. 
For players want to modify the script, please download 'controller.ahk'. You will also need to install AutoHotKey from https://www.autohotkey.com/ to run the script. You don't need to compile the script before running it as long as you have AutoHotKey installed. You may need to read AutoHotKey documents if you also want to modify the script to suit your need.

For players outside China, you may find the instructions a little hard to understand. However, all key combinations will be writen in English in the window opened by this program. Be brave and try their functions out! The overall rules are, CapsLock in combination with other keys enable a various of functions. 1-9 and + in combination with CapsLock will be mapped to their numberpad alternatives for those who play on a small keyboard. W, E, Space, Ctrl, Left Button and Right Button in combination with CapsLock will generate a loop the corresponding key event. F in combination with CapsLock will click Left Button every four second. P in combination with CapsLock will have the player poop continuously on a toilet when he or she is ready to poop. All Loop will be stoped by Delete.

这个软件是我自己玩方舟的小工具，欢迎下载、修改和应用，但是责任自负！下载controller.exe并运行即可使用。请注意本程序仅支持Windows。

如何使用：
只是想使用程序的Windows玩家可以在‘releases’中下载最新版‘controller.exe’。正常运行该文件即可，程序将打开一个窗口。该窗口存在时所有组合键均生效，关闭窗口也将废止组合键。
想修改脚本的玩家请下载‘controller.ahk’。此外你还需要从https://www.autohotkey.com/ 安装AutoHotKey。在安装好AutoHotKey的情况下，脚本无需编译即可使用。要修改脚本功能请参考AutoHotKey文档。
