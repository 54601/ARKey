# ARKey
Keyboard and mouse controller for ARK

This program is created to suit my own needs when playing ARK, you are welcomed to download, modify and use it at your own risk! To use, simply download controller.exe and run.

features:
1. CapsLock + 0~9 will trigger the same number in numeric keypad to be pressed. The same goes with CapsLock + '+'.
2. CapsLock + E/W will start a loop in which E/W is pressed indefinitely until Delete is pressed.
3. CapsLock + F will start a loop in which the game recieve a left-click every 4 seconds.
4. CapsLock + left/right-click will start a loop in which the corresponding button is clicked fastly and indefinitely until Delete is pressed.

Known Bugs:
1. CapsLock sometimes will be triggered despite the fact that it's disabled so long as the program is running and serves as a functional key instead. In that case it's impossible to reset CapsLock unless the program is closed. To do so, close the program's pop-up window, and every thing should go back to normal. This bug seems to be related to too many combined keys are pressed, without Delete to kill loops in between. All debug suggestions are welcomed.

2021-08-22: The order of keys pressed down don't matter any more. For example, pressing W then CapsLock will have the same effect as pressing CapsLock then W.

适用于方舟：生存进化的键鼠控制器。

这个软件是我自己玩方舟的小工具，欢迎下载、修改和应用，但是责任自负！下载controller.exe并运行即可使用。

功能：
1. CapsLock + 任意数字键/+号等于按下小键盘对应数字键/+号。
2. CapsLock + W/E将连续按下w/e，直到Delete被按下。
3. CapsLock + F将每隔4秒按下一次左键，直到Delete被按下。
4. CapsLock + 左键/右键将连续按下左键/右键，直到Delete被按下。

已知Bug：
尽管程序运行期间，CapsLock键应已被禁用并作为组合键发挥作用，但是有时CapsLock还是会被打开。此时只能关闭程序之后才能关掉大写锁定。关闭程序的方法和关闭其他窗口一样叉掉就行。这个Bug似乎在连续按下很多组合键，中间不使用Delete打破循环的情况下才会出现。欢迎一切修改建议。

2021-08-22：按键的先后顺序不再有影响。例如，先后按下W和CapsLock的效果是一样的。
